# SQL Project: Data Analysis for Zomato - A Food Delivery Company

## Overview

This project demonstrates my SQL problem-solving skills through the analysis of data for Zomato, a popular food delivery company in India. The project involves setting up the database, importing data, handling null values, and solving a variety of business problems using complex SQL queries.

![ERD](https://github.com/MDABRAR-Git/zomato_sql_project/blob/main/ER%20Diagram.png)
## Project Structure

- **Database Setup:** Creation of the `zomato_db` database and the required tables.
- **Data Import:** Inserting sample data into the tables.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling null values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Business Problems:** Solving 15 specific business problems using SQL queries.



## Database Setup
```sql
CREATE DATABASE zomato_db;
```

### 1. Dropping Existing Tables
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS deliveries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS Orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS restaurants;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS riders;

CREATE TABLE customers(
	   customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	   customer_name varchar(35),
	   reg_date DATE
	);
	
	
	CREATE TABLE restaurants(
	   restaurant_id int primary key,
	   restaurant_name varchar(55),
	   city varchar(20),
	   opening_hours varchar(40)
	
	);
	
	CREATE TABLE orders(
	     order_id int primary key,
		 customer_id int ,
		 restaurant_id int,
		 order_item varchar(20),
		 order_date DATE,
		 order_time TIME,
		 order_status varchar(55),
		 total_amount float,
		 FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
		 FOREIGN KEY (restaurant_id) REFERENCES restaurants(restaurant_id)
	);
	alter table orders
	drop column order_item,
	add order_item varchar(35);
	
	CREATE TABLE riders(
	rider_id int primary key,
	rider_name varchar(50),
	sign_up date
	);
	
	CREATE TABLE deliveries(
	delivery_id int primary key,
	order_id int,
	delivery_status varchar(50),
	delivery_time TIME,
	rider_id int,
	FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (rider_id) REFERENCES riders(rider_id)
	);
```

## Data Import

## Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Before performing analysis, I ensured that the data was clean and free from null values where necessary. For instance:

```sql
--1.For customers table
select count(*) from customers
where customer_id is null
or customer_name is null
or reg_date is null;


--2.for orders table 
select count(*) from orders
where order_id is null
or order_item is null
or customer_id is null
or  restaurant_id is null
or 	 order_item is null
or 	 order_date is null
or 	 order_status is null
or 	 total_amount is null;



--2.for restaurants table 
select count(*) from restaurants
where restaurant_id is null
or restaurant_name is null
or   city is null
 or  opening_hours is null;


select count(*) from riders
where
rider_id is null
or rider_name is null
or sign_up is null;


select count(*) from deliveries
where
 delivery_id is null
 or order_id is null
or delivery_status is null
or delivery_time is null
or rider_id is null;
```

## Business Problems Solved

### 1. Write a query to find the top 5 most frequently ordered dishes by customer called "Arjun Mehta" in the last 1 year.

```sql
SELECT 


SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    dishes,
    total_order,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_order DESC) AS rank
FROM (
    SELECT
        c.customer_id,
        c.customer_name,
        o.order_item AS dishes,
        COUNT(*) AS total_order
    FROM
        customers AS c
        JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    WHERE
        c.customer_name = 'Sameer Khan'
        AND o.order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '720 days'
    GROUP BY
        c.customer_id,
        c.customer_name,
        o.order_item
		) as per_dish

ORDER BY
    total_order DESC;

```

### 2. Popular Time Slots
-- Question: Identify the time slots during which the most orders are placed. based on 2-hour intervals.

**Approach 1:**

```sql
-- Approach 1
SELECT 
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 as start_time,
	FLOOR(EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time)/2)*2 + 2 as end_time,
	COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

**Approach 2:**

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 0 AND 1 THEN '00:00 - 02:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '02:00 - 04:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '04:00 - 06:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 7 THEN '06:00 - 08:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 8 AND 9 THEN '08:00 - 10:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 10 AND 11 THEN '10:00 - 12:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 13 THEN '12:00 - 14:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 14 AND 15 THEN '14:00 - 16:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 16 AND 17 THEN '16:00 - 18:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 19 THEN '18:00 - 20:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 20 AND 21 THEN '20:00 - 22:00'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM order_time) BETWEEN 22 AND 23 THEN '22:00 - 00:00'
    END AS time_slot,
    COUNT(order_id) AS order_count
FROM Orders
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY order_count DESC;
```

### 3. Order Value Analysis
-- Question: Find the average order value per customer who has placed more than 750 orders.
-- Return customer_name, and aov(average order value)

```sql

select c.customer_name,c.customer_id,avg(total_amount)

```

### 4. High-Value Customers
-- Question: List the customers who have spent more than 100K in total on food orders.
-- return customer_name, and customer_id!

```sql

select c.customer_name,c.customer_id,sum(total_amount)
  FROM
        customers AS c

having sum(total_amount)>100000;

```

### 5. Orders Without Delivery

## Conclusion

This project highlights my ability to handle complex SQL queries and provides solutions to real-world business problems in the context of a food delivery service like Zomato. The approach taken here demonstrates a structured problem-solving methodology, data manipulation skills, and the ability to derive actionable insights from data.
